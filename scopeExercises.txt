1) Determine what this Javascript code will print out (without running it):
x = 1;
var a = 5;
var b = 10;
var c = function(a, b, c) {
var x = 10;
document.write(x);
document.write(a);
var f = function(a, b, c) {
b = a;
document.write(b);
b = c;
var x = 5;
}
f(a,b,c);
document.write(b);
 }
c(8,9,10);
document.write(b);
document.write(x);
}

2) What is the difference between a method and function?

- A function can be called directly by its name.
- A method consists of a code that can be called by the name of its object and
   its method name using dot notation or square bracket notation..
- A function lives on its own.
- A method is a function associated with an object property.

3) What does 'this' refer to when used in a Java method?
	
	In Java, this refers to the current object.

4)  What does 'this' refer to when used in a JavaScript method?

	The JavaScript this keyword refers to the object it belongs to.

5) What does 'this' refer to when used in a JavaScript constructor function?
		
	The keyword this inside the constructor function points to the newly created object

6)Assume object x is the prototype for object y in Javascript. Object x has a method f( ) containing keyword 'this'.
When f is called by x.f( ), what does 'this' refer to?

	So when x inherits the function f of y, 'this.a' means x.a, the own property 'a' of x.
	In conclusion, It refers to x.

7)What is a free variable?

	A variable referred to by a function that is not one of its parameters or local variables.

8)Create an object that has properties with name = "fred" and major="music" and a property that is a function
that takes 2 numbers and returns the smallest of the two, or the square of the two if they are equal.

	const person = {
    		name:"fred",
    		major:"music",
    		smallOrSquare : function(a,b){
            		if(a === b){
              			return a*a;		
            		}
            		if(a<b){
                		return a;
            		}
            		return b;
    }
  }

9) Write Javascript code for creating three Employee objects using the "new" keyword and a constructor function.
Employee objects have the following fields: name, salary, position

function Employee(name, salary, position) {
	this.name = name;
	this.salary = age;
	this.position = position;
}

var george = new Employee("George Smith", 33000, "engineer");
var ken = new Employee("Ken Jones", 39000, "hr");
var john = new Employee("John Doe", 45000, "director");

10) Write a Javascript function that takes any number of input arguments and returns the product of the
arguments.

function findProduct() {
	var i;
	var product = 1;
	for (i = 0; i < arguments.length; i++) {
		product = product * arguments[i];
	}
	return product;
}

11)Write an arrow function that returns the maximum of its three input arguments.

var maxValue = (num1,num2,num3) => {
	var max = num1;
    if(max<num2){
    	max = num2;	
    }
    if(max<num3){
    	max = num3;
    }
    return max;
	
}
